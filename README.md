# Gxt Editor

A desktop editor for Rockstar `.gxt` files, built with Tauri.

Rockstar’s game *Manhunt* uses `.gxt` files to store in-game dialogue. This tool provides a convenient way to view and edit those files.

Most of the code was generated by ChatGPT, based on my existing C++ implementation and a GDScript (Godot) version of the GXT parsing/editing logic.
